# MyScoreBook

The apllication has been coded using pair programming

*Description of the application 

Our application, Score Book, is meant to help users to keep track of their
games and as well as the player's scores from specific games for when they 
are playing board games or others such as football. By creating an account 
in our app, it ensures that a back up of the games and scores is created
and it can be access from any phone as long as the user is logged in.

Playing many board games, it became hard for us to keep track of the scores,
so we realised it can be difficult for others as well and since in this era 
of technology only digital games have a track of their scores, we created 
the Score Book app to migrate from writing on paper to a tap away on the phone.
